## Getting Started (with Dev Containers)

### 1. Launch VSCode  
Open Visual Studio Code.

### 2. Open the Project Folder in VSCode  
Go to **File → Open Folder** and select the folder where the project is cloned.

### 3. Install VSCode Extension  
If you see a message at the bottom of VSCode saying **"Do you want to install the recommended extensions from GitHub, Microsoft and others for this repository?"**, click **Install** to install the **Dev Containers** extension along with other recommended extensions.

### 4. Reopen the Project in a Container  
Click the **bottom left corner** of the VSCode window where it says **"Open a Remote Window"** → **Reopen in Container**.  

### 5. Wait for the Container to Build and Set Up  
Wait while the **Dev Container environment is being prepared**. This process may include **downloading the base image**, **installing required tools and libraries**, and **building the Docker image if necessary**.  
Depending on your internet speed and system performance, this may take **a few minutes**.  
If you see a message prompting you to install recommended extensions like in the previous steps, click **Install** to install the extensions in the container environment.

### 6. Debug the Project  
Open `/workspace/src/main.rs` and press **F5** to start debugging.  
The project will be **compiled and executed inside the container**, and the output will be visible in the **Debug Console**.

### 7. Cross-Build the Project  
Open the command palette: Press **Ctrl + Shift + P** (macOS: **Cmd + Shift + P**) → **Tasks: Run Task** → **Build all release targets**.
